# Data Engineer Technical Challenge üíª

## Introduction üé¨

First of all, congrats ü•≥. We've enjoyed our initial chat and are pleased that you've decided to consider joining the Koodoo engineering team!

As a way to introduce you to our way of building software we've put together a (small) technical challenge for you to complete before the next stage of the process.

## Assumptions and requirements ‚úÖ

As an experienced data engineer üèó, you'll hopefully be familiar with:

* Scripting languages like python or bash

* Querying languages like SQL

* Data processing pipelines

* A solid understanding of how to construct robust data models 

* General software system fundamentals üí™

## The challenge üíª

There are two parts to this assignment.

### Part A

Put together a script or program (using any language or technology of your choice) that: 

1.) Retrieves "Top Stories" from this parliament data RSS feed endpoint: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/rss/doc/top-stories/en.xml

Sample response:

```

    <title>Top stories - European Parliament</title>
    <link>https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en</link>

```
2.) Outputs a CSV file of the data.


### Part B 

Write a README walkthrough guide which explains how to use your script, any installation steps and any bits of information required to help someone else run the script.

We recommend that you spend more time on this walkthrough / document than the actual script itself and really focus on the developer experience of using, and running your script.

Use Markdown to write your README.

### Things to consider in your solution ü§î

- Does it solve/run for the basic case?
- Does it handle different scenarios?
- How portable is it?
- How does someone run it on any machine?

We're not looking for a 100% full proof solution (which might not exist anyway depending on the use case).

You should provide your solution by submitting your code in the form of a Gist or GitHub repository. ü§ù
